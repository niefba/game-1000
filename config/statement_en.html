      <p>
        Players take turns.<br>
        The player receives 6 dices
      </p>
      <p>
        If the dices are used to score points, you can either score the points or replay the dice.
        <br>
        To replay the dice, you must keep at least one of them.
        <br>
        If a dice roll fails to score points, all accumulated points are lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each 1 is worth 100 points and each 5 is worth 50 points.
        A three of a kind is worth 100 times the value of the number on the dice, except in the case of a three of 1s, which is worth 1,000 points.
        Each additional number identical to the one making up a three of a kind doubles the value of the combination immediately below it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A 5 is worth 50 points</li>
        <li>A 1 is worth 100 points</li>
        <li>Three 2s are worth 200 points</li>
        <li>Three 3s are worth 300 points</li>
        <li>Three 4s are worth 400 points</li>
        <li>Three 5 are worth 500 points</li>
        <li>Three 6 are worth 600 points</li>
        <li>Three 1's worth 1,000 points</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Four of a kind (four dice of the same value), five of a kind (five dice of the same value) and six of a kind (six dice of the same value) double the value of the combination just below them.
        For example, a three of 2 is worth 200 points, a four of 2 is worth 400, a straight of 2 is worth 800 and a six of 2 is worth 1,600. For a combination to count, it must be obtained in a single throw.
      </p>
      <p>
        A sequence of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in a single throw is worth 1,500 points.<br>
